Let's get together.


Let's pick a time and place!

| Person   |      Available      |Place |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|
| Anton|  Any time after work or after 7:30pm| Somewhere in NE? |
| Ryan |  Any time after 7:30pm| Somewhere not in the boonies |
| Matt |  Whenever.  I just need a few days heads up | Anywhere within 30 minutes of my house |

P.S.  (Matt P.) I tried to modifying this using a clone, and I failed to actually commit it back.  Resorted to using the online editor.  I'm a failure as a developer.  

Did you really just create a repo to invite me to hang out?

[AL] this seems like a really "unefficient" means of communication. There are far superior methods.

[RB] Monica is such a nerd...

[ML] I know. Right?!

[MP] Stating for the record, I said this was super nerdy, but awesome.  Props to Monicer.

## I hate all of you.

[MP] For real... let's do something with this information.  It was a funny idea, but somebody other than me has to put something on the calendar... or I guess I can do it again.
